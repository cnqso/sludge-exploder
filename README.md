# Sludge Exploder

Brute, barbaric, unsophisticated algo blocker for Chrome.

Block sites, feeds, and individual elements. Options available for timed breaks.

Requires manual config for maximum friction. As long as you don't press the "disable" button you'll be good. And you wouldn't do that, right?

## Why

Because I'm an ADDICT! I needed a very configurable site block/modification routine, and none of the available extensions were ideal for me.

## Why distribute through github instead of through the extensions store?

Because it's important that the extension is dictated by ugly, temperamental JSON so that you aren't constantly tempted to modify your carefully crafted configuration screen. Your only job is to NOT hit the "disable" button. How hard could that possibly be?

## Setup
1. Download the directory wherever you desire (I'd advise against Desktop or Downloads)
2. Modify the "config.json" if you'd like (Comes preloaded with an *omakase* feed block schedule that you're free to try)
3. Go to [chrome://extensions/](chrome://extensions/)
4. Enable "developer mode" in the top-right, then hit "Load unpacked" in the top left
5. Choose the "Sludge Exploder" folder you just downloaded
6. Never, ever hit the "disable button"
7. (Optional) Hit "Details" and enable "Allow in Incognito"

If you ever modify the config.json, make sure to reload the extension with the little refresh button next to the disable button.
